# Crawlora OpenLigaDB API client for Java

The official Java client for Crawlora's hosted OpenLigaDB API. It exposes 22 endpoints covering sports and league discovery, fixtures, match results, standings, scorers, and team match history. Requests use your `x-api-key`; the client does not connect to the upstream site directly.

## Install

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.crawlora</groupId>
  <artifactId>crawlora-openligadb</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Use

Create an account at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net/signup?utm_source=maven-central&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=openligadb-java-signup), then open the [Crawlora console](https://crawlora.net/app?utm_source=maven-central&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=openligadb-java-console) to get an API key.

```java
import net.crawlora.openligadb.Client;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Map;

try (Client client = new Client(System.getenv("CRAWLORA_API_KEY"))) {
    Object result = client.leagues(Map.ofEntries(Map.entry("season", 2026)));
    System.out.println(result);
}
```

Each operation has a direct method that accepts the parameters documented for that endpoint. Use `client.request(operationId, params)` for generic dispatch. `Client.OPERATION_IDS`, `Client.OPERATION_COUNT`, `client.getOperationIds()`, and `client.getOperationCount()` describe this platform's operations only.

For custom hosted API routing and timeouts, use `new Client(apiKey, baseUrl, Duration.ofSeconds(20))`. Text responses are returned as `String`; JSON responses are parsed into Java maps, lists, and scalar values.
